CryptoFlow is an android application that gives you information about crypto-currencies and a tool to convert them into standard currencies! It is also an application that allows you to follow the latest news about the crypto universe.

Note : This application has been developed under Android Studio with a Pixel 4 API 29's emulator

## API 
We used the following APIs:

### Flow & Convert:
To retrieve the different cryptocurrencies and their prices, we chose to use the API of coingecko.com. Documentation: https://www.coingecko.com/fr/api/documentation

### Media:
For the Media part, we used the API of newsapi.org. To use this API, it is necessary to create an account and to use an API key when calling. Documentation: https://newsapi.org/docs

## Flow 
The application is composed of 3 parts. The main screen, Flow, is the open-up screen. It gives access to the prices of the top 10 cryptocurrencies.

## Convert
The second part, Convert, allows you to quickly give you an overview of the value of a given amount of cryptocurrency in euros. The same cryptos as in Flow are available for conversion. In this part of the application, we don't make a call to the API but we use the one made on "Flow" to keep the different cryptos and their values.

## Navigation
The navigation menu at the bottom of the application allows you to easily navigate through the different panels. The active panel is highlighted with a different coloring from the other two inactive ones.
